# SuperHero-.Net-Crud
A project built with .NET and Angular can be used to create a web application that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) using SQL Server Express and Microsoft Entity Framework.

.NET provides a framework for building web applications, and Angular is a front-end framework that allows developers to create dynamic web applications. SQL Server Express is a lightweight version of the SQL Server database management system, while Microsoft Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database operations in .NET applications.

To create a CRUD application, you can use Angular to create the user interface and .NET to create the backend API. You can use Microsoft Entity Framework to map the database tables to C# classes and then use those classes to perform CRUD operations.

For example, you could create an Angular form to add a new record to the database. When the user submits the form, Angular sends an HTTP request to the .NET API, which uses Entity Framework to add the new record to the database.

Similarly, you could create an Angular table to display records from the database. When the user clicks on a record to edit or delete it, Angular sends an HTTP request to the .NET API, which uses Entity Framework to update or delete the record in the database.

Overall, this project architecture allows for a scalable and maintainable web application with a responsive user interface and efficient database operations.
